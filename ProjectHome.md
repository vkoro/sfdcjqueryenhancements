Provides custom components which replaces all of the standard apex inputFields with JQuery UI elements and provides additional functionality beyond what is included with the input field, including automatic custom Javascript validation with the JQuery Validation plugin.

Please see http://ui-enhancements-developer-edition.na7.force.com/testEnhancedComponentsfor a live version of these jQuery elements.

All elements are easily styled with jQuery Themeroller




Please also see our formation package, which includes a form builder for Salesforce which can optionally be configured to use the jQuery elements.
